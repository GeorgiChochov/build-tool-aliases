# Build Tool Aliases
This project aims to provide a simple way to reuse your build tool aliases across projects that use different build tools.
For example, if you use _maven_ for one project and _gradle_ for another and you want to use the same aliases to work with both these shell scripts might be able to help.

## Installation
You can clone this repository and run the `install.sh` script
```bash
git clone git@github.com:GeorgiChochov/build-tool-aliases.git
bash ./build-tool-aliases/install.sh
```

Or you can do what the [`install.sh` script](install.sh) does manually.
